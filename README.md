# My New Project

Project 2 for Xtern Bootcamp 2018 Session 1.

Day 4 HW
Make the delete button work.
Make the fav button change the style of the list item in some way.
Delete the whole page

Make the fav button also change the object in the array. 

add buttons to move the flick up and down the list
make the buttons also change their place in the array

allow users to edit the names of the flicks in the list after they are added. wouldn't it be nice if we could make that span's "content editable."
